# Project Title: What The Fish Does This Mean?

The fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) has come a long way with global support and efforts. With global partnerships and technology advancements, we can now leverage on data and technological capabilities to monitor sea activities. For example, AI-powered electronic monitoring systems that enables observer programs to increase coverage. Satellite-based data analyzed through machine learning can show vessel movements. Finally, databases have enabled detailed inspection of vessels' history, including changes in names and their ownership.

A combination of all these data paints a robust illustration on vessel activity and identity.In our project we aim to value-add to these efforts by contextualizing and providing visualization insights through dynamic displays and identification of suspicious patterns that may warrant further investigations.
