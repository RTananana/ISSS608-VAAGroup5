With global partnerships and technology advancements, we can now leverage on data and technological capabilities to monitor sea activities. For example, AI-powered electronic monitoring systems that enables observer programs to increase coverage. Satellite-based data analyzed through machine learning can show vessel movements. Finally, databases have enabled detailed inspection of vessels’ history, including changes in names and their ownership.\nA combination of all these data paints a robust illustration on vessel activity and identity.In our project we aim to value-add to these efforts by contextualizing and providing visualization insights through dynamic displays and identification of suspicious patterns that may warrant further investigations."

    "text": "Fish and other seafood provides nutrients for more than three billion people globally and is an income source for 10%-12% of the world’s population (The Nature Conservancy, 2021). Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) reports that Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing represents up to 26 million tonnes of fish caught annually (FAO, 2023). IUU remains one of the greatest global threats as it results in overfishing, which threatens marine biodiversity, livelihoods, aggravates poverty, and increases food insecurity (IMO, 2019). Given the global impact that IUU causes, there has been international efforts to account for IUU fishing and a call-to-action to fight IUU. As part of the efforts, Agreement on Port State Measures (PSMA) was instituted in Jun 2016, which is the first binding international agreement specifically designed to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing by denying port access and use to foreign vessels engaging in or supporting such fishing (FAO, 2023). By 2022, 60% of global port states are committed to PSMA (Responsible Seafood Advocate, 2022). Given the global participation, data points have been made available through Global Information Exchange System (GIES) which can be leveraged on to produce data-driven analysis for trend indicators of IUU and gaps identified to tighten IUU measures. Currently, there exists a IUU Fishing Index that provides a measure of the degree to which states are exposed to and effectively combat IUU fishing. The score map allows for oversight on the state-of-health for each region (IUU Fishing Index, 2023).\n\n\n\nScore Maps"

    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nEDA is a crucial step in understanding the dataset by utilizing data visualization techniques. It serves to identify any issues or anomalies within the data and uncover valuable insights about the relationships between variables and underlying patterns present in the dataset. By employing a combination of univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations, as well as summary statistics, a comprehensive understanding of the dataset can be gained.\nEDA also plays a significant role in examining the distribution of existing entities within the dataset. By analyzing the type and country data, it becomes possible to discern and comprehend the distinct patterns exhibited by suspicious entities compared to those categorized as non-suspicious.\nThrough EDA, the team hope to uncover potential data quality issues, detect outliers, identify missing values, and verify the consistency of the dataset. Furthermore, it enables the exploration of correlations, trends, and dependencies between variables, shedding light on hidden insights that might inform further analysis or investigative efforts.\nBy conducting a thorough EDA, the team can gain a holistic understanding of the dataset, discover meaningful patterns, and generate valuable knowledge that aids decision-making and subsequent analysis tasks."

    "text": "Network Graph\nNetwork graphs, along with centrality measures, provide a powerful tool for identifying potential illegal fishing activities. By constructing a network graph based on relationships and interactions among entities involved in fishing and maritime trade, we can analyze the centrality measures of these entities. Centrality measures, such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality, allow us to assess the relative importance and influence of each entity within the network. In the context of illegal fishing, entities with high centrality scores may indicate key players or hubs that are potentially involved in illegal activities. By focusing on these influential entities and their connections, we can uncover hidden patterns, detect suspicious relationships, and identify clusters of entities that exhibit abnormal behavior. Network graph analysis, combined with centrality measures, provides a valuable approach to pinpoint potential illegal fishing activities and target further investigation and intervention efforts effectively."

    "text": "Predictive Modelling (Random Forest)\nRandom Forest, a machine learning algorithm, is an effective tool for identifying entities involved in illegal fishing activities. By utilizing its classification capabilities, Random Forest can analyze relevant contextual features to distinguish between legal and illegal fishing entities. The algorithm’s ability to handle imbalanced data is particularly valuable in this context, as the number of illegal fishing instances is often significantly smaller than legal fishing activities.\nDuring training, Random Forest employs a randomized selection process, where subsets of the data and features are chosen to construct multiple decision trees. By considering various contextual factors, such as, fishing locations, trade records and partners, and regulatory compliance, the algorithm can capture the distinguishing patterns and relationships that signify potential involvement in illegal fishing practices.\nThrough the collective decision-making of the ensemble of trees, Random Forest generates predictions for each entity, considering the contextual features. The final determination of whether an entity is likely engaged in illegal fishing is based on the majority vote or average prediction across the decision trees.\nThe strength of Random Forest lies in its ability to leverage the collective knowledge embedded within the contextual features to identify entities associated with illegal fishing. Its robustness to imbalanced data, coupled with the power of its ensemble approach, makes it a valuable tool in addressing the challenges of detecting and combating illegal fishing activities."
